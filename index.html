                <p>Hatsune Miku (Japanese: 初音ミク), also called Miku Hatsune, and officially code-named CV01,[2][3] is a
                    Vocaloid software voicebank developed by Crypton Future Media and its official anthropomorphic
                    mascot character, a 16-year-old girl with long, turquoise twintails. Miku's personification has been
                    marketed as a virtual idol, and has performed at live virtual concerts onstage as an animated
                    projection (rear-cast projection on a specially coated glass screen).</p>
                <p>Miku uses Yamaha Corporation's Vocaloid 2, Vocaloid 3, and Vocaloid 4 singing synthesizing
                    technologies. She also uses Crypton Future Media's Piapro Studio, a standalone singing synthesizer
                    editor. She was the second Vocaloid sold using the Vocaloid 2 engine and the first Japanese Vocaloid
                    to use the Japanese version of the 2 engine. The voice is modeled from Japanese voice actress Saki
                    Fujita.</p>
                <p>The name of the character comes from merging the Japanese words for first (初, hatsu), sound (音, ne),
                    and future (ミク, miku),[a] thus meaning "the first sound of the future",[2] which, along with her
                    code name, refers to her position as the first of Crypton's "Character Vocal Series" (abbreviated
                    "CV Series"), preceding Kagamine Rin/Len (code-named CV02) and Megurine Luka (code-named CV03). The
                    number 01 can also be seen on her left shoulder in official artwork.</p>

                <p>Hatsune Miku was the first Vocaloid developed by Crypton Future Media after they handled the release
                    of the Yamaha vocal Meiko and Kaito. Miku was intended to be the first of a series of Vocaloids
                    called the "Character Vocal Series" (abbreviated "CV Series"), which included Kagamine Rin/Len and
                    Megurine Luka. Each had a particular concept and vocal direction.</p>
                <p>She was built using Yamaha's Vocaloid 2 technology, and later updated to newer engine versions. She
                    was created by taking vocal samples from voice actress Saki Fujita at a controlled pitch and tone.
                    Those samples all contain a single Japanese phonic that, when strung together, creates full lyrics
                    and phrases. The pitch of the samples was to be altered by the synthesizer engine and constructed
                    into a keyboard-style instrument within the Vocaloid software. </p>
                <p>Crypton released Hatsune Miku on August 31, 2007. Crypton had the idea to release Miku as "an android
                    diva in the near-future world where songs are lost."[9] Hatsune Miku was released for Vocaloid 3 on
                    August 31, 2013, including an English vocal library.[10] She was the first Vocaloid to be developed
                    by the company, following their commercial release handle of Yamaha Corporation developed vocals
                    "Meiko" and "Kaito", making Hatsune Miku the third Vocaloid to be sold commercially by the company

            <div class="accordion-panel">
                <p>On April 30, 2010, a new add-on for Vocaloid 2 called Hatsune Miku Append, was released, consisting
                    of six different timbres for the voice: Soft (gentle timbre), Sweet (young, chibi quality), Dark
                    (mature and melancholic), Vivid (bright and cheerful), Solid (loud, clear voice), and Light
                    (innocent and angelic).[12] Miku Append was created to expand Miku's voice library, and as such
                    requires the original program to be installed on the user's computer first.[13] This was the first
                    time a Vocaloid had such a release, and more Append versions were reported from Crypton Future Media
                    at later dates.</p>
                <p>It was mentioned that a 7th Append voicebank, a falsetto voice, had been recorded; however, since the
                    developers didn't think it would be useful on its own, no plans were made for an independent
                    release.[15] During the Kagamine Append development, a "darkish Whisper/Sweet" append was being
                    considered.[16] Miku's English vocal was also due for a Vocaloid 2 release, but it was not released
                    in the engine due to low quality.</p>
                <p>To aid in the production of 3D animations, the program MikuMikuDance was developed by an independent
                    programmer. The freeware software allowed a boom in fan-made animations to be developed, as well as
                    being a boost for promoting Vocaloid songs themselves.[18] This spawned "NicoNico Cho Party", where
                    fans could submit their animations to accompany live holographic performances of popular Vocaloid
                    songs.</p>
                <p>An English voicebank for Hatsune Miku was announced in 2011 and was to be released by the end of
                    2012. However, the decision to move to Vocaloid 3 and issues with English pronunciation delayed the
                    release.[19] It was finally released on August 31, 2013 via digital distribution.</p>
                <p>The Hatsune Miku Vocaloid 3 Japanese vocal library was released on September 26, 2013. It contained
                    updates to all previous Vocaloid 2 vocals except Vivid and Light. These were later released
                    separately, though they were initially offered to anyone who already owned Hatsune Miku, Hatsune
                    Miku Append, and Hatsune Miku V3. Once imported into Vocaloid4, all Vocaloid3 Hatsune Miku vocals
                    could use the new Cross-Synthesis system (XSY) built for the new engine of Vocaloid 3. The voice was
                    also imported into a device called Pocket Miku, released on April 3, 2014.</p>
                <p>Hatsune Miku received an update for Yamaha's Vocaloid 4 engine under the name of Hatsune Miku
                    V4X.[21] It makes use of the new EVEC system for Piapro Studio, a VSTi plugin used as an alternative
                    to the traditional Vocaloid Editor. EVEC consists of recorded vowels. Along with the consonant, a
                    different vocal tone can be achieved. Two vocal tones are included in the EVEC system: Power and
                    Soft. Along with the new EVEC system, phoneme errors found in Miku's V2 and V3 voicebanks would be
                    fixed allowing for easier manipulation of the software's voice. As of August 31, 2016, Hatsune Miku
                    V4X/V4 English was released. </p>

            <div class="accordion-panel">
                <p>Sapporo has been a major main target of sponsorship since 2010, with Crypton Future Media sponsoring
                    the winter festivals. The image of Hatsune Miku would appear around the town on public
                    transportation. The image portrayal of Miku that is used is a derivative design called "Snow Miku".
                    Although originally, this was simply a recoloring of the normal Hatsune Miku, unique designs have
                    occurred every year since 2011. Figurines based on the design have also been featured.</p>
                <p>The 2012 design was chosen via a contest. The winning entry was referred to as "Fluffy Coat Snow
                    Miku". The 2013 design was called "Strawberry Daifuku Shiromuku Miku".[49][50] The 2014 design was
                    based on a Magical Girl design by dera_fury, who was the winner of the 2014 Snow Miku contest.[51]
                    The illustration was "Nekosumi". The design also featured a pet called "Rabbit Yukine". The 2015
                    design was called "Snow Bell Snow Miku" and was illustrated by Nardack.</p>
                <p>In 2012, several ice sculptures of the Character Vocal series and several snow sculptures of Miku
                    were produced for the event. However, on February 7, 2012, one of the Snow Miku sculptures later
                    collapsed and had to be rebuilt elsewhere with better support. The collapsed figure also hit a woman
                    in her early 60s on the back of the head; no serious injuries were sustained in the process.</p>
                <p>During Miku's development, Crypton decided to take a different approach from that used by the other
                    Vocaloid sound bank publishers.[citation needed] It was decided that to make the product successful
                    not only would a highly appealing voice need to be developed, but that the voice needed an image.
                    She was originally aimed only at professional producers; the amateur and otaku market had not fully
                    formed yet, and so were not initially considered.</p>

            <div class="accordion-panel">
                <p>Nico Nico Douga, a Japanese video streaming website similar to YouTube, played a fundamental role in
                    the recognition and popularity of the software. Soon after Miku's release, Nico Nico Douga users
                    started posting videos of songs created using the character's sound bank. According to Crypton, a
                    popular video featuring Miku's chibi version, Hachune Miku, singing and dancing to "Ievan Polkka"
                    while spinning a Welsh onion in homage to Loituma Girl's original video (which led to Miku also
                    being commonly associated with spring onions) demonstrated the potential of the software in
                    multimedia content creation.[59] As Miku's recognition and popularity grew, Nico Nico Douga became a
                    place for collaborative content creation. Popular original songs written by a user would inspire
                    illustrations, animations in 2D and 3D, and remixes by other users. Some creators would show their
                    unfinished work and ask for ideas.</p>
                <p>In September 2009, three figurines based on the derivative character "Hachune Miku" were launched in
                    a rocket from the United States state of Nevada's Black Rock Desert, though it did not reach outer
                    space.[61][62] In late November 2009, a petition was launched in order to get a custom-made Hatsune
                    Miku aluminium plate (8 cm × 12 cm, 3.1" × 4.7") made that would be used as a balancing weight for
                    the Japanese Venus spacecraft explorer Akatsuki.[63] Started by Hatsune Miku fan Sumio Morioka (also
                    known as "chodenzi-P"), this project has received the backing of Dr. Seiichi Sakamoto of the Japan
                    Aerospace Exploration Agency. On December 22, 2009, the petition exceeded the needed 10,000
                    signatures necessary to have the plates made. An original deadline of December 20, 2009, had been
                    set to send in the petition, but due to a couple of delays in the Akatsuki project, a new deadline
                    of January 6, 2010, was set; by this deadline, over 14,000 signatures had been received. On May 21,
                    2010 at 06:58:22 (JST), Akatsuki was launched, having three plates depicting Hatsune Miku and
                    Hachune Miku in several monochrome images, composed of the miniature letters of the messages from
                    the petition form etched in the plates.[64][65] The UK 59th issue of the music and fashion magazine
                    Clash featured Hatsune Miku as their cover star (using a real-life photo model), with a full feature
                    on her.[66] The third launch of the MOMO sounding rocket by Interstellar Technologies used Hatsune
                    Miku's voice for the countdown.</p>
                <p>The Vocaloid software has also had a great influence on the character Black Rock Shooter, who looks
                    like Hatsune Miku but is not linked to her by design. The character was made famous by the song
                    "Black Rock Shooter",[68] and a number of figurines have been made. An original video animation made
                    by Ordet was streamed for free as part of a promotional campaign running from June 25 to August 31,
                    2010.[69] A televised anime series aired in February 2012.</p>
                <p>In October 2011, Crypton showed on the official Hatsune Miku Facebook page a letter from the Japanese
                    Minister of Economy for "contributing to the furtherance of the informatization by minister of
                    economy."[citation needed] The flag of the city of Chiba was considered to coincidentally resemble
                    the silhouette of Hatsune Miku, and on the 10th anniversary on August 31, 2017, the municipal
                    government website temporarily changed its logo to look like Miku.[71] Geoffrey Cain of GlobalPost
                    has argued that the phenomenon of Hatsune Miku is partly due to the love of Japanese for giving
                    inanimate objects a soul, which is rooted in Shintoism or animism, but also in the long tradition of
                    Karakuri ningyō or automated wooden puppets. Thus, Japanese are much more ready to accept a virtual
                    character as "human".</p>
                <p>Hatsune Miku is often jokingly attributed as the creator of the video game Minecraft (originating
                    from the Miku Twitter parody account mikumiku_ebooks which tweeted "i created minecraft") as well as
                    the book series Harry Potter. Both of these attributions came about after the original creators of
                    both works (Markus Persson and J. K. Rowling, respectively) published tweets that were critical of
                    transgender people, which resulted in backlash from their respective fans.</p>
